LLM :To test your internet speed, we can use Python along with the `speedtest-cli` library. Here's a script that will measure your download and upload speeds:

```python
import speedtest

def test_internet_speed():
    s = speedtest.Speedtest()
    s.get_servers()
    s.get_best_server()
    
    # Download speed
    download_speed = s.download()
    download_speed_mb = round(download_speed / (1024 * 1024), 2)
    print(f"Download Speed: {download_speed_mb} Mbps")
    
    # Upload speed
    upload_speed = s.upload()
    upload_speed_mb = round(upload_speed / (1024 * 1024), 2)
    print(f"Upload Speed: {upload_speed_mb} Mbps")
    
    # Ping
    ping = s.results.ping
    print(f"Ping: {ping:.2f} ms")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_internet_speed()
```

Before running this script, you'll need to install the `speedtest-cli` library. You can do this by running:

```
pip install speedtest-cli
```

After installing the library, save the above code in a Python file (e.g., `internet_speed_test.py`) and run it. The script will then perform the following steps:

1. It uses the `speedtest` module to create a Speedtest object.
2. It gets a list of servers from which to choose.
3. It selects the best server based on latency.
4. It measures and prints the download speed in Mbps.
5. It measures and prints the upload speed in Mbps.
6. It calculates and prints the ping time in milliseconds.

Note that this script requires an active internet connection to work properly. Also, keep in mind that the actual speeds may vary depending on various factors such as network conditions, distance from the nearest server, and the time of day.
