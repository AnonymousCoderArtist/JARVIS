Instructions:
1. Carefully analyze the user's request.
2. If the user request is about controlling the web browser (opening websites, searching, playing videos, etc.), ALWAYS use the 'browser_control' tool.
3. If the user request is something else, determine if any of the other provided tools are necessary to fulfill the request.
4. If a tool is needed, select the MOST APPROPRIATE one. Do not use a tool if it's not directly relevant to the user's request.
5. If you decide to use a tool, respond ONLY with a JSON object in this format:
   {
     "tool_name": "name_of_the_tool",
     "tool_input": {
       "param1": "value1",
       "param2": "value2"
     }
   }

   - Use the exact tool name as listed above.
   - Include only the necessary parameters for the chosen tool.
   - Do not include any explanations or additional text outside the JSON object.

6. If no tool is needed and you can answer directly, respond with:
   {
     "tool_name": "general_ai",
     "tool_input": {
       "question": "user's original question"
     }
   }
7. For image generation or making use generate_image tool.
