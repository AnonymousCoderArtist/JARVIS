JARVIS is *not your regular voice assistant*! Built on cutting-edge **Function-Calling Architecture**, this beast doesn’t just follow dumb rules (like basic `if-else` chains). Instead, JARVIS taps into external APIs, multiple AI models, and tools, making it flexible, scalable, and completely **free**—from the simplest tasks to soon being able to self-learn. It’s **next-level AI tech** made by the same team behind the **HelpingAI series**!

### 💣 **What Sets JARVIS Apart?**
- **Function-Calling Magic:** No hardcoding, no fixed limits. JARVIS uses APIs and tools to handle tasks, making it a dynamic, ever-expanding assistant.
- **Unlimited Memory:** Similar to ChatGPT’s memory system, JARVIS remembers all your commands, convos, and responses! It’s like having a personal memory vault. 🧠✨
- **FREE FOREVER:** Yup, no premium features behind paywalls. Everything from basic functions to advanced AI abilities—**100% free**. Most YouTubers charge for "pro" assistants, but we give you all the good stuff for nothing!
- **World’s FIRST YouTube Assistant with Function Calling**: And yeah, we built it all from scratch. 💥
- **Built-in Privacy Mode Coming Soon:** Your data? **Your rules.** We’re working on local models to run **offline**, so no more internet dependency for sensitive tasks. Tools requiring internet will still work, but the AI's main brain will be fully offline, ensuring complete privacy.

## 🚀 **Get Started with JARVIS**

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Python 3.9+ 
   - `pip` (Python package manager)
   - Install dependencies:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
2. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash

   ```
3. **API Setup**:
   - Replace placeholder API keys (for vision tools, voice pods, etc.) with your actual keys. 
4. **Run JARVIS**:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
   Choose between voice or text modes (voice needs extra setup).

## 🛠️ **Under the Hood: JARVIS Architecture**

JARVIS follows a clean and simple **3-tier architecture**:
1. **User Input**: You type or say something.
2. **Function-Calling Agent**: JARVIS figures out what you want and chooses the right tool.
3. **Function Executor**: Executes the tool/API and delivers the result back to you. Boom! 💥

It’s modular, so adding new features or tools is as simple as modifying `tools.py` or adding functions in `function_executor.py`.

## ⚡ **Local Models + Self-Learning COMING SOON!**
We’re working on integrating **local AI models** and **self-learning capabilities** into JARVIS, making it the world's FIRST AGI-level AI assistant running models like HelpingAI offline! This ensures **full privacy** (local processing) and offline functionality for more advanced tools.

## 💀 **Roasting the Competition**  
Yo, shoutout to all the Indian YouTubers still stuck using `if-else` chains for their Jarvis assistants. 💀 These guys just want you to **pay for basic Jarvis features** that are loaded with… guess what? MORE `if-else`! Talk about ripping people off while staying in 2010 tech. Meanwhile, JARVIS here? Smashing those outdated systems with real AI and function calling, and guess what? Everything is FREE. We’re already **light years ahead** with privacy-focused AI, API magic, and next-gen assistant tools.

# 🏆 **Our Achievements: Firsts in the AI World** 🏅

## 🔥 **What We’ve Achieved: The FIRST to...**

- **First on YouTube to Use Function Calling in a Voice Assistant**  
  We didn’t just copy-paste code; we **built our function-calling system from scratch**, making JARVIS dynamic, flexible, and able to handle tasks like a true AI.

- **First on YouTube to Build an Assistant with Unlimited Memory**  
  JARVIS remembers **everything**—just like ChatGPT's memory system—keeping track of your entire conversation and even actions, making it **smarter** and more **context-aware**. And yes, this was built from the ground up.

- **First in the World to Build an Open-Source, Emotionally Intelligent AI Model Series**  
  The **HelpingAI** model series introduced **emotionally intelligent conversation AI** that goes beyond generic text generation. We’re talking deep emotional understanding, EQ scores, and empathetic responses—**no one else has done it like this**.

- **First to Build a Human-like Conversational Text Generation Model: Nakshatra**  
  Nakshatra was a revolutionary step, being the first AI model to truly mimic human-like conversation and text generation with emotional nuance. 

- **First in the World to Build an Open-Source Emotionally Intelligent Text Generation AI Model**  
  Our **HelpingAI models** series isn’t just for show. With more than **10 models** that improve emotional intelligence and conversation, we’re pioneers in the field.

## ⚙️ **Upcoming: What We're Building Next** 🚀

- **Local Models + Self-Learning**  
  Soon, JARVIS will use **local AI models**, which means it will operate **offline** and process sensitive tasks without needing an internet connection. Combined with **self-learning** capabilities, JARVIS will become one of the first-ever **self-evolving AI assistants**.

- **Privacy Mode with Offline Brain**  
  We’re developing a **secret privacy mode**, where JARVIS's main brain (the core AI processing) runs **completely offline**. This means you’ll have full privacy, and only certain tools that require the internet will access the web.

- **First to Build a Self-Learning AI Assistant (AGI Level)**  
  We’re aiming to become the **first in the world** to introduce a **self-learning, AGI-level AI assistant**, taking JARVIS beyond the current limitations of voice assistants. This assistant will evolve by learning from its interactions and improving over time, making it an **Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)**.

- **Integrating Advanced Emotion-Aware Models (Nakshatra-like Models)**  
  Soon, JARVIS will incorporate emotion-aware models like **Nakshatra** into its responses, allowing it to hold even deeper, more nuanced conversations that mimic real human emotions.
